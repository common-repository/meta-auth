== Description ==

2-Factor authentication is a tedious process that can be simplified using the functionality of signed messages with a private key with an overall flow completed in the minimum possible waiting time. Unique identification of an account with a public address is cryptographically trivial (and secure) to authenticate. That's what Meta Auth brings to the table.

= How it works =

On login, the plugin shows a 2FA authentication popup as an extra security layer. Users have to verify their identity by connecting their crypto wallet and signing an encrypted message.
